# FsRaytracer

A raytracer written in F#, based on [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend) by Peter Shirley.

## Features

The raytracer fully implements the code from the book, but is written in a functional programming style.
On top of the normal features, it also supports parallelized rendering.

## Example

The RaytracerCLI binary will produce an image similar to this (but with lower resolution):
